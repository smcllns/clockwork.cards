Didn't catch this during implementation because smoke test only checked content rendering, not animation behavior.","learning":"When using SolidJS <For> with arrays derived from reactive signals that update frequently, use <Index> instead (position-stable) or ensure array references are stable. Always consider animation/transition behavior when reactive data drives list rendering — content correctness alone isn't sufficient verification."}

The params belonged to the Section, not individual cards, but were duplicated on every card.","learning":"Controls that users need to discover should be visible at the level they belong to. Don't hide section-level controls inside individual card interactions — show them at the section level with a clear toggle."}

Sam pushed back: don't add speculative features to any list until there's an actual need. Wait for the real birthday card implementation to surface real requirements.","learning":"Don't add speculative features to backlogs. Only track work items that have demonstrated need. Building the real product will surface real requirements — speculating ahead of that wastes planning energy."}
