Didn't catch this during implementation because smoke test only checked content rendering, not animation behavior.","learning":"When using SolidJS <For> with arrays derived from reactive signals that update frequently, use <Index> instead (position-stable) or ensure array references are stable. Always consider animation/transition behavior when reactive data drives list rendering — content correctness alone isn't sufficient verification."}
