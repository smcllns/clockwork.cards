{"timestamp":"2026-01-29T18:08:15-08:00","situation":"SolidJS <For> with derived arrays that recompute every tick (e.g. facts() depending on 1s timer signal) destroys/recreates DOM elements each render, resetting CSS animations mid-flip. Didn't catch this during implementation because smoke test only checked content rendering, not animation behavior.","learning":"When using SolidJS <For> with arrays derived from reactive signals that update frequently, use <Index> instead (position-stable) or ensure array references are stable. Always consider animation/transition behavior when reactive data drives list rendering — content correctness alone isn't sufficient verification."}
{"timestamp":"2026-01-29T20:25:59-08:00","situation":"Param controls were hidden behind a small gear icon on each FlipCard's settings face. User couldn't find them. The params belonged to the Section, not individual cards, but were duplicated on every card.","learning":"Controls that users need to discover should be visible at the level they belong to. Don't hide section-level controls inside individual card interactions — show them at the section level with a clear toggle."}
{"timestamp":"2026-01-29T20:26:00-08:00","situation":"Added cross-section param sharing to the deferred backlog. Sam pushed back: don't add speculative features to any list until there's an actual need. Wait for the real birthday card implementation to surface real requirements.","learning":"Don't add speculative features to backlogs. Only track work items that have demonstrated need. Building the real product will surface real requirements — speculating ahead of that wastes planning energy."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-11T11:36:06-08:00","situation":"Kept pkilling and restarting Bun dev server between code changes, causing it to appear to 'die' repeatedly","learning":"Bun dev server has excellent HMR. Start it once and let it hot-reload. Never pkill/restart between code changes."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-11T11:55:47-08:00","situation":"Dispatched subagents as general-purpose type but they couldn't Read or Bash. Re-dispatched with specs inline but they still couldn't write files or commit. Needed Bash agent type for full autonomy.","learning":"Use subagent_type=Bash when agents need to read/write files, install deps, and commit. General-purpose agents may have restricted tool permissions."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-11T20:15:04-08:00","situation":"Pushed to main and deployed to Vercel without testing production build. Had two bugs: process.env not inlined (runtime crash) and empty string not triggering ?? fallback (NaN). Both caught only after live deploy broke.","learning":"Always run bun run build and serve dist/ locally before pushing to deploy. Dev server inlines env vars differently than production build. Verify the production artifact, not just the dev server."}
