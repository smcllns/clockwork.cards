# Hero V6–V9 Variations

## V6: Dying Lightbulbs
Based on V5 (Neon Circuits). After chaos/broken: balls stop bouncing, glow flickers irregularly like lightbulbs losing power, then fades to black. Feeling: "I've broken the display."

**Key changes from V5:**
- Broken mode: after balls settle, individual per-ball flicker timers
- Each ball dies at random time (staggered 1-5s). Flicker = random intensity oscillation that slows, then emissive → 0
- Bloom fades with the balls. Background stays dark.
- Final state: all dark, nothing glowing

## V7: Full-Viewport Glass Floor
Based on V6. Same dying lightbulbs but:
- Three.js canvas = full viewport width (not constrained to container)
- Balls never cropped left/right — canvas edge = browser edge
- Clear "glass floor" — balls rest on invisible floor but viewer never clips them at bottom
- Walls pushed to viewport edges, floor visible boundary clear

**Key changes:**
- Canvas uses `position: fixed; inset: 0; width: 100vw; height: 100vh` or equivalent
- Camera/walls computed from full viewport, not container
- Floor collider positioned so balls rest above container bottom edge with margin

## V8: Neon Letters
Different visual style — instead of bouncing balls, 3D neon letter tubes.
- Off: dark metallic/glass letters (like reference image left side)
- On: neon glow, hue-cycling, circuit board background (like reference image right side)
- Broken/chaos: letters swing, detach, fall and smash on ground. Fragments scatter.

**Key changes:**
- Replace sphere geometry with extruded text or box-based letter shapes
- Use FONT bitmap data to build letter geometry (boxes per pixel, like approach-d)
- Neon material: emissive tubes with bloom
- Chaos: remove spring forces, add gravity, angular velocity to simulate falling signs

## V9: Two Buttons Focus
Redesign the button UX. Two prominent buttons:
1. **"Press this button"** — big, beautiful, inviting CTA. Should feel irresistible.
2. **"Never press this button"** — dangerous, powerful, forbidden feel.

Place wherever feels right — likely "Press" centered/prominent, "Never" smaller/corner.
"Press" = shiny toggle, "Never" = chaos/break.
This is a UI/layout change to `index.tsx` Hero component, not a new Three.js variation.
