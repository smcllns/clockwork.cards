Happy Birthday Oscar!
Today is February 20th, 2026, which means you're 9 years old today! That's 3,287 days — 78,888 hours — 4,733,280 minutes — or 283,996,800 seconds of being awesome.
You're a space traveler. Since Earth moves at 67,000 mph, you've traveled 5.3 billion miles through space in your lifetime. A beam of light would need 7.8 hours to cover that distance. And since the solar system is drifting through the Milky Way at 490,000 mph, you've also cruised about 38 billion miles across the galaxy. You're not just a kid — you're an interstellar traveler. 🧑‍🚀
Your body is incredible. You've taken about 75 million breaths since birth — and every one pulled in oxygen that might have once been breathed out by a dinosaur. You've blinked 50 million times without noticing. Your heart has beaten 400 million times without being asked. Every day, your body pumps blood through 100,000 km of blood vessels — enough to wrap around the Earth two and a half times. It does this while you're eating cereal. It never asks for a thank you.
Your brain is extraordinary. It has 100 billion neurons, each connecting to thousands of others — more possible connections than stars in the observable universe. A kid's brain uses about 30% of the body's energy, more than an adult's, because it's building and rewiring connections faster right now than it ever will again. Right now, reading this sentence, your brain is using more energy than your legs would use walking a few steps.
Your life in numbers. If you've eaten 50g of yogurt every day since age 4, that's 91 kg — the weight of a baby hippo. If you've walked 8,000 steps a day, you've taken 26 million steps. If you laugh 15 times a day, you've burned 64,000 calories laughing — the same as running 25 marathons. You've drunk about 5,000 liters of water, which is only 0.2% of an Olympic swimming pool — you'd need another 4,500 years to fill the rest. You've spent 6 solid days brushing your teeth. You've said 56 million words. If you'd never cut your hair, it'd be 1.3 meters long.
Healthy stuff is powerful. Every glass of milk is another brick building your skeleton. Every fruit and vegetable is a repair kit for your cells. Every minute of running makes your lungs stronger. Every night of sleep is a librarian organizing your brain. And every hug — about 6,500 so far — is a moment where your body said "this person is important to me." ❤️
One more thing. The iron in your blood — the stuff that makes it red — was forged inside an exploding star billions of years ago. You are literally built from the stars. ☄️
Oh, and 9 is 1001 in binary: (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (0 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9.
Happy 1001st birthday, Oscar.
