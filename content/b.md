# Happy Birthday Oscar
Today is [`Feburary 20th 2026`], which means you're 9 years old today!
<!-- Dates update daily, so
the day before this said this:
 ... you're 8.984 years old ...
-->

## -- SPACE --

⏳ That's 3,287 days — 78,888 hours — 4,733,280 minutes — or 283,996,800 seconds of being awesome.

🚀 That's 9 laps around the sun. And since Earth is moving at 67,000 [mph], in your liftime so far, you've traveled 5.3 billion [miles] through space!* You're not just a kid — you're an interstellar traveler. 🧑‍🚀

Did you know the iron in your blood — the stuff that makes it red — was made inside a star that exploded billions of years ago. The actual iron atoms in your blood were forged in an actual supernova. You are literally built from the stars.

_*Though lets be real, light would still whoop you in a race: travelling at 669,600,000 [mph], it would take a beam of light just 7.8 hours to cover the same distance that took you 9 years!_

## -- FUN -- 

If you've eaten [50g] of yogurt every day since you were [4], that's about 91 kg total — roughly the weight of a baby hippo. 

If you've walked [8,000] steps a day, you've taken about 26 million steps in your life so far. Laid end to end, those steps would stretch x,000 [miles]!

Your hair grows about [1.2] [cm] per month. If you'd never had a haircut, your hair would now be about 1.3 [meters] long!

If you poop 1.5 times per day on average, you've pooped around 4,931 times so far.

## -- MATH --

Σ 
9 is 1001 in binary. "Binary" just means using base 2, which computers often use, while humans mostly write numbers in base 10. "Base 10" means our numbers grow through powers of ten: 10->100->1000. Binary is exactly the same idea, but instead of powers of 10, it uses powers of 2 like 2->4->8->16. And we can do all the same calculations but with different numbers! Weird right? But the math checks out:

In base 2, 1001 means: 1 eight, 0 fours, 0 twos, and 1 one, which adds up to 9.
1001sub(2) = (1 x 2^3) + (0 x 2^2) + (0 x 2^1) + (1 x 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9

In base 10, 9 means: no hundreds and no tens and nine ones, which adds up to 9.
9sub(10) = (0 x 10^3) + (0 x 10^2) + (0 x 10^1) + (9 x 10^0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 9

## -- HEALTHY -- 

🪥
If you spend [2] minutes brushing your teeth every morning and night since age [3], you've spent about 146 hours brushing — that's over 6 solid days of nothing but brushing, and over 1.5 million brush strokes! 

(Think that's a lot of repetitive movement? You've blinked about 50 million times so far!)

🥦
Every time you eat fruits and vegetables, you’re getting vitamins and antioxidants that help protect your cells from damage. If you eat [3] servings of fruit and veg a day, that’s about 9,861 “tiny repair kits” delivered since you were born. Your body does the hard work — your job is to keep sending supplies.

💪
Every minute you spend running or playing hard, your lungs pull in 40-60 [liters] of air, compaerd with 5-8 [litres] when resting. By age 9, if you play hard for [1] hour a day your lungs have handled around 11 million extra [liters] of air compared to just sitting around. Running around isn't just fun — it's a workout for your lungs, and yours are getting seriously strong.

❤️ 
If you hug someone for [10] seconds, your body releases oxytocin, which lowers stress and helps you feel calm and safe. If you’ve given about [2] hugs a day since you were born, that’s roughly 6,500 little moments where your body is quietly saying: “This person matters to me.”

🧠
Every night you sleep, your brain sorts through everything you learned that day and files it into long-term memory — like a librarian working the night shift. If you sleep [10] hours a night, your brain has had about 32,870 hours of filing time. That's almost 4 years of a tiny librarian in your head organizing your entire life so far, making sure you remember the important things.

💧
If you drink about [6] glasses of water a day (that's about 1.5 [liters]), you've drunk roughly 5,000 [liters] of water in your life. That sounds like a lot — but an Olympic swimming pool holds 2.5 million liters, so actually you've only drank 0.2% of one. At the same rate, it would take you about 4,500 more years to drink the rest of the pool. 

## END / FLIP

We love you, we love your mind, happy 9th birthday bud ❤️
