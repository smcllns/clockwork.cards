# Happy Birthday Oscar
Today is February 20th, 2026, which means you're 9 years old today!

⏳ That's 3,287 days of being awesome.
    or 78,888 hours
    or 4,733,280 minutes
    or 283,996,800 seconds

🚀 That's 9 laps around the sun. And since Earth is moving at 67,000 mph, you've traveled 5.3 billion miles through space so far! You're not just a kid — you're an interstellar traveler. 🧑‍🚀
 
(Though let's be real, light would still whoop you in a race: at
669,600,000 mph, it would cover that distance in just 7.8 hours!)

## Your life in numbers

If you have been eating [50g] of yogurt every day since you were [4],
that's about 91 kg — roughly the weight of a baby hippo.

If you walk [8,000] steps a day on average since you were [3], you've taken about 26 million steps in your life so far.

If you spend [2] minutes brushing your teeth every morning and night since age [3], you've spent more than 6 days brushing your teeth have done over 1.5 million brush strokes! 

Think that's a lot? You've blinked about 50 million times so far!

Your hair grows about [1.2] [cm] per month. If you'd never had a
haircut, your hair would now be about 1.3 [meters] long!

If you poop [1.5] times per day on average, you've pooped around
4,931 times so far.

## Your brain and body

🧠 Every night while you sleep, your brain sorts through everything
you learned that day and files it into long-term memory — like a
librarian working the night shift. If you sleep [10] hours a night,
your brain has had about 32,870 hours of filing time. That's almost
4 years of a tiny librarian organizing your entire life so far.

🥦 Every time you eat fruits and vegetables, you're getting vitamins
and antioxidants that help protect your cells. If you eat [3] servings
a day, you've delivered 9,861 "repair kits" to your cells since you
were born. Your body does the hard work — your job is to keep
sending supplies.

❤️ If you hug someone for [10] seconds, your body releases oxytocin,
which helps you feel calm and safe. If you've given about [2] hugs
a day since you were born, that's roughly 6,500 positive moments
where your body is quietly saying: "This person matters to me."

💪 Every minute you spend running or playing hard, your lungs pull
in 40-60 [liters] of air, compared with 5-8 when resting. If you
play hard for [1] hour a day, your lungs have handled around 11
million extra [liters] of air. Running around isn't just fun — it's
a workout for your lungs, and yours are getting seriously strong.

💧 If you drink about [6] glasses of water a day, you've drunk
roughly 5,000 [liters] in your life. An Olympic swimming pool holds
2.5 million liters, so you've drunk 0.2% of one. It would take
about 4,500 more years to drink the rest!

## One more thing

In binary, 9 is 1001. 

"Binary" is what computers often use. It just means base 2. Humans mostly write numbers in base 10, where numbers grow in powers of ten: 10→100→1000. Binary is the same idea but with powers of 2: 2→4→8→16.

In base 2, 1001 means: 1 eight, 0 fours, 0 twos, and 1 one:
In math symbols: 1001₂ = (1×2³) + (0×2²) + (0×2¹) + (1×2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9

In base 10, 9 means ... 9. But think of it as: 0 hundreds, 0 tens, and 9 ones:
In math symbols: 9₁₀ = (0×10²) + (0×10¹) + (9×10⁰) = 0 + 0 + 9 = 9

Any math problem you can solve in base 10, you can also solve in base 2 — or base 3, or any base you want. You're just writing the numbers differently. It's like how "nine", "neuf", "nueve", and "九" all mean the same thing in different languages — 9 and 1001 are the same number in different bases.
