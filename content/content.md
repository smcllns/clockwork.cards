# Snippets — Oscar's 9th Birthday Card

## Intro

Today is [`Feburary 20th 2026`], which means you're 9 years old today!
<!-- Dates update daily, so the day before this said: ... you're 8.984 years old ... -->

## Closing

We love you, we love your mind, happy 9th birthday bud ❤️

## Space & Time

<!-- v1 — full cascade -->
⏳ That's 3,287 days — 78,888 hours — 4,733,280 minutes — or 283,996,800 seconds of being awesome.
<!-- v2 — short -->
<!-- That's 3,287 [days] of being awesome. -->
<!-- [days | hours | minutes | seconds ] -->

🚀 That's 9 laps around the sun. And since Earth is moving at 67,000 [mph], in your liftime so far, you've traveled 5.3 billion [miles] through space!* You're not just a kid — you're an interstellar traveler. 🧑‍🚀

<!-- v1 — italicized footnote -->
_*Though lets be real, light would still whoop you in a race: travelling at 669,600,000 [mph], it would take a beam of light just 7.8 hours to cover the same distance that took you 9 years!_
<!-- v2 — parenthetical -->
<!-- (*Though lets be real, light would still whoop you in a race: travelling at 669,600,000 [mph], it would take a beam of light just 7.8 hours to cover the same distance that took you 9 years!) -->

<!-- v1 — no emoji, "Did you know" -->
Did you know the iron in your blood — the stuff that makes it red — was made inside a star that exploded billions of years ago. The actual iron atoms in your blood were forged in an actual supernova. You are literally built from the stars.
<!-- v2 — emoji, "not just a metaphor" -->
☄️ The iron in your blood — the stuff that makes it red — was made inside a star that exploded billions of years ago. You're not just made of "star stuff" as a metaphor. The actual iron atoms in your actual blood were forged in an actual supernova. You are literally built from the stars.

You've taken about 75 million breaths since birth. Every single breath pulled in oxygen that might have once been breathed out by a dinosaur — the same air molecules get recycled, so statistically, you've definitely inhaled dinosaur breath.

## Body & Health

Every single day, your body warms about [5 liters] of blood to exactly 37°C and pumps it through 100,000 [km] of blood vessels — that's enough to wrap around the Earth two and a half times. Your body does this while you're eating cereal. It does it while you're sleeping. It never even asks for a thank you. (But a bit like having a pet it really appreciates healthy food, water and exercise!)

<!-- v1 — "40-60 liters", "11 million", "by age 9" -->
💪 Every minute you spend running or playing hard, your lungs pull in 40-60 [liters] of air, compaerd with 5-8 [litres] when resting. By age 9, if you play hard for [1] hour a day your lungs have handled around 11 million extra [liters] of air compared to just sitting around. Running around isn't just fun — it's a workout for your lungs, and yours are getting seriously strong.
<!-- v2 — "53 million", no "by age 9" -->
<!-- 💪 Every minute you spend running or playing hard, your lungs pull in 40-60 [liters] of air, compaerd with 5-8 [litres] when resting. So if you play hard for [1] hour a day, your lungs have processed roughly 53 million extra [liters] of air compared to just sitting around. Running around isn't just fun — it's a workout for your lungs, and yours are getting seriously strong. -->
<!-- v3 — "about 40 liters", "six times more" framing -->
<!-- 💨 Every minute you spend running or playing hard, your lungs pull in about [40] [liters] of air — six times more than when you're sitting still. If you play actively for [1] hour a day, your lungs have processed roughly 53 million extra [liters] of air compared to just sitting around. Running around isn't just fun — it's a workout for your lungs, and yours are getting seriously strong. -->

<!-- v1 — "helps you feel calm and safe", "quietly saying" -->
❤️ If you hug someone for [10] seconds, your body releases oxytocin, which lowers stress and helps you feel calm and safe. If you've given about [2] hugs a day since you were born, that's roughly 6,500 little moments where your body is quietly saying: "This person matters to me."
<!-- v2 — "makes you feel safe", "positive moments" -->
<!-- ❤️ If you hug someone for [10] seconds, your body releases oxytocin, which lowers stress and makes you feel safe. If you've given about [2] hugs a day since you were born, that's roughly 6,500 postive moments where your body feels "this person is important to me". -->

## Food & Drink

If you've eaten [50g] of yogurt every day since you were [4], that's about 91 kg total — roughly the weight of a baby hippo.
<!-- a small dog, a 1 year old horse, a baby hippo, an adult panda, etc -->

<!-- v1 — "tiny repair kits", "your body does the hard work" -->
🥦 Every time you eat fruits and vegetables, you're getting vitamins and antioxidants that help protect your cells from damage. If you eat [3] servings of fruit and veg a day, that's about 9,861 "tiny repair kits" delivered since you were born. Your body does the hard work — your job is to keep sending supplies.
<!-- v2 — "little repair kits", "your cells are incredibly well-maintained" -->
<!-- 🥦 Every time you eat a fruit or vegetable, your body extracts vitamins that protect your cells from damage. If you eat [3] servings of fruit and veg a day, you've given your body about 9,861 little repair kits since you were born. Your cells are incredibly well-maintained. -->

<!-- v1 — "most of it used to build and strengthen" -->
🥛 Every glass of milk has about 300 mg of calcium. If you've had [1] glass a day since age [2], that's about 766 grams of calcium — most of it used to build and strengthen your bones. Right now your skeleton is basically a construction site, and calcium is the concrete. Every glass is another brick.
<!-- v2 — "your body has absorbed", "used almost all of it" -->
<!-- 🥛 Every glass of milk you drink has about [300 mg] of calcium. If you've had [1] glass a day since age [2], your body has absorbed roughly 766 grams of calcium — and used almost all of it to build your bones. Right now, your skeleton is basically a construction site, and calcium is the concrete. Every glass is another brick. -->

> Do a drinking water version of this:
If you drink about [300 ml] of milk a day since age [1], you've drunk about 876 [liters] of milk in your life. That would be enough to fill a regular 25m swimming pool almost half way!

<!-- v1 — "4,500 more years to drink the rest of the pool" -->
💧 If you drink about [6] glasses of water a day (that's about 1.5 [liters]), you've drunk roughly 5,000 [liters] of water in your life. That sounds like a lot — but an Olympic swimming pool holds 2.5 million liters, so actually you've only drank 0.2% of one. At the same rate, it would take you about 4,500 more years to drink the rest of the pool.
<!-- v2 — "4,500 years to drink all the water in an Olympic swimming pool!" -->

## Brain & Learning

<!-- v1 — adult 20% -->
Your brain uses about 20% of all your body's energy, even though it only weighs about 1.3 [kg]. Pound for pound, your brain is the most power-hungry organ you own — it's running at full speed even when you think you're doing nothing. Right now, reading this sentence, your brain is using more energy than your legs would use to walk across the room.
<!-- v2 — kids 30%, expanded -->
<!-- Did you know a kid's brain actually uses more energy than an adult? An adult uses about 20% of their body's energy on their brain. At age 9, your brain is burning through closer to 30% because it's hard at work building and rewiring connections as you learn new things. But your brain only weighs 1.3 [kg] which if you weigh 50 [kg] is just 2% of your body! So pound for pound, your brain is your most power hungry organ! Right now, reading this sentence, your brain is using more energy than your legs would use walking a few steps! -->

🧠 Every night you sleep, your brain sorts through everything you learned that day and files it into long-term memory — like a librarian working the night shift. If you sleep [10] hours a night, your brain has had about 32,870 hours of filing time. That's almost 4 years of a tiny librarian in your head organizing your entire life so far, making sure you remember the important things.

Your brain has about 100 billion neurons, and each one can connect to thousands of others. That means the number of possible connections in your brain is greater than the number of stars in the entire observable universe. Every time you learn a new math fact or figure out a tricky problem, you're literally rewiring something more complex than the cosmos. Not bad for someone who's only 9.

Σ
9 is 1001 in binary. "Binary" just means using base 2, which computers often use, while humans mostly write numbers in base 10. "Base 10" means our numbers grow through powers of ten: 10->100->1000. Binary is exactly the same idea, but instead of powers of 10, it uses powers of 2 like 2->4->8->16. And we can do all the same calculations but with different numbers! Weird right? But the math checks out:

In base 2, 1001 means: 1 eight, 0 fours, 0 twos, and 1 one, which adds up to 9.
1001sub(2) = (1 x 2^3) + (0 x 2^2) + (0 x 2^1) + (1 x 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9

In base 10, 9 means: no hundreds and no tens and nine ones, which adds up to 9.
9sub(10) = (0 x 10^3) + (0 x 10^2) + (0 x 10^1) + (9 x 10^0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 9

If you've read [15] pages a day since age [5], you've read over 21,900 pages. That's like reading about half a school library!

## Fun Numbers

If you've walked [8,000] steps a day, you've taken about 26 million steps in your life so far. Laid end to end, those steps would stretch x,000 [miles]!

Your hair grows about [1.2] [cm] per month. If you'd never had a haircut, your hair would now be about 1.3 [meters] long!

If you poop 1.5 times per day on average, you've pooped around 4,931 times so far.

<!-- v1 — "25 marathons" -->
If you laugh about [15] times a day, you've laughed roughly 49,000 times since you were born. Scientists say each laugh burns about 1.3 calories so you've burned about 64,000 calories from laughing so far in your life — about the same energy as running 25 marathons.
<!-- v2 — "about 25 marathons" -->

If you say about [120] words per minute when you're talking, and you talk for about [3] hours a day (since age [2]), you've said roughly 56 million words by now!

<!-- v1 — parenthetical aside -->
🪥 If you spend [2] minutes brushing your teeth every morning and night since age [3], you've spent about 146 hours brushing — that's over 6 solid days of nothing but brushing, and over 1.5 million brush strokes!
(Think that's a lot of repetitive movement? You've blinked about 50 million times so far!)
<!-- v2 — single paragraph -->

If you stacked one book on top of another for every day that you've been alive, that would 3,287 books. And if each book is about 2 [cm] thick, your stack would be about 32 meters tall — taller than a 10-storey building.

🛰️ If you spent [50%] of your time stacking LEGO bricks, and each brick took [3] seconds, you'd have a tower of 47 million bricks — tall enough to reach the International Space Station ... twice!
