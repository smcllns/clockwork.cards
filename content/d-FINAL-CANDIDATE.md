# Happy Birthday Oscar
Today is February 20th, 2026, which means you're 9 years old today!

⏳ That's 3,287 days of being awesome.
    or 78,888 hours
    or 4,733,280 minutes
    or 283,996,800 seconds

🚀 That's 9 laps around the sun. And since Earth moves at 67,000 mph, you've traveled 5.3 billion miles through space so far! You're not just a kid — you're an interstellar traveler. 🧑‍🚀

(Though let's be real, light would still whoop you in a race: at 669,600,000 mph, it would cover that distance in just 7.8 hours!)

## Your life in numbers

If you've eaten [50g] of yogurt every day since you were [4], that's about 91 kg — roughly the weight of a baby hippo.

If you've walked [8,000] steps a day since you were [3], you've taken about 26 million steps in your life so far.

If you spend [2] minutes brushing your teeth every morning and night since age [3], you've spent over 6 solid days brushing, and done over 1.5 million brush strokes!

Think that's a lot? You've blinked about 50 million times so far.

Your hair grows about [1.2cm] per month. If you'd never had a haircut, your hair would now be about 1.3 meters long!

If you poop [1.5] times per day on average, you've pooped around 4,931 times so far.

## Your brain and body

🧠 Every night while you sleep, your brain sorts through everything you learned that day and files it into long-term memory — like a librarian working the night shift. If you sleep [10] hours a night, your brain has had about 32,870 hours of filing time. That's almost 4 years of a tiny librarian organizing your entire life so far.

🥦 Every time you eat fruits and vegetables, you're getting vitamins that help protect your cells. If you eat [3] servings a day, you've delivered about 9,861 "repair kits" to your cells since you were born. Your body does the hard work — your job is to keep sending supplies.

❤️ If you hug someone for [10] seconds, your body releases oxytocin, which helps you feel calm and safe. If you've given about [2] hugs a day since you were born, that's roughly 6,500 moments where your body is quietly saying: "This person matters to me."

💪 Every minute you spend running or playing hard, your lungs pull in 40–60 liters of air, compared with 5–8 when resting. If you play hard for [1] hour a day, your lungs have handled around 11 million extra liters of air. Running around isn't just fun — it's a workout for your lungs, and yours are getting seriously strong.

💧 If you drink about [6] glasses of water a day, you've drunk roughly 5,000 liters in your life. That sounds like a lot — but an Olympic swimming pool holds 2.5 million liters, so you've only drunk 0.2% of one. At this rate, it would take you about 4,500 more years to drink the rest of the pool.

## One more thing

In binary, 9 is 1001.

"Binary" is what computers use — it just means base 2. Humans write numbers in base 10, where digits grow in powers of ten: 10 → 100 → 1000. Binary is the same idea but with powers of 2: 2 → 4 → 8 → 16.

In base 2, there are only two numbers: 0 and 1.
In base 2, 1001 means: 1 eight, 0 fours, 0 twos, and 1 one.
1001₂ = (1×2³) + (0×2²) + (0×2¹) + (1×2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9

In base 10, there are 10 numbers: 0-9.
In base 10, 9 is ... 9. But writing it the same way: 0 hundreds, 0 tens, 9 ones.
9₁₀ = (0×10²) + (0×10¹) + (9×10⁰) = 0 + 0 + 9 = 9

Any problem you can solve in base 10, you can also solve in base 2, or any other base*. You're just writing the numbers differently. It's like how "nine", "neuf", "nueve", and "九" all mean the same thing in different languages. 9 and 1001 are the same number in different bases.

(*In base 16, there are 16 digits: 0–9 and A–F, where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15. So how would we write 9₁₆?)

We love you, we love your mind, happy 1001st birthday Oscar. ❤️
