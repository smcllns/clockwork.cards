# Happy Birthday Oscar
Today is [`Feburary 20th 2026`], which means you're 9 years old today!

## -- SPACE --
[mph | km]

⏳ That's 3,287 days — 78,888 hours — 4,733,280 minutes — or 283,996,800 seconds of being awesome.

🚀 That's 9 laps around the sun. And since Earth is moving at 67,000 [mph], in your liftime so far, you've traveled 5.3 billion [miles] through space!* You're not just a kid — you're an interstellar traveler. 🧑‍🚀

_(Though lets be real, light would still whoop you in a race: travelling at 669,600,000 [mph], it would take a beam of light just 7.8 hours to cover the same distance that took you 9 years!)_

## -- FUN -- 
If you've eaten [50g] of yogurt every day since you were [4], that's about 91 kg total — roughly the weight of a baby hippo. 

If you've walked [8,000] steps a day, you've taken about 26 million steps in your life so far. Laid end to end, those steps would stretch x,000 [miles]!

Your hair grows about [1.2] [cm] per month. If you'd never had a haircut, your hair would now be about 1.3 [meters] long!

If you poop 1.5 times per day on average, you've pooped around 4,931 times so far.

## -- MATH --

In binary, which computers use, 9 is 1001. "Binary" just means using base 2. Humans mostly write numbers in base 10. "Base 10" means our numbers are organized in powers of ten: 10->100->1000. Binary is exactly the same idea, but instead of powers of 10, it uses powers of 2 like 2->4->8->16. We can do all the same calculations with either! Weird right? But the math checks out:

In base 2, 1001 means: 1 eight, 0 fours, 0 twos, and 1 one, which adds up to 9.
1001sub(2) = (1 x 2^3) + (0 x 2^2) + (0 x 2^1) + (1 x 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9

In base 10, 9 means: no hundreds and no tens and nine ones, which adds up to 9.
9sub(10) = (0 x 10^3) + (0 x 10^2) + (0 x 10^1) + (9 x 10^0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 9

## -- HEALTHY -- 

🪥 [input type=number-dial] [input type=number-dropdown]

If you spend [2] minutes brushing your teeth every morning and night since age [3], you've spent about 146 hours brushing — that's over 6 solid days of nothing but brushing, and over 1.5 million brush strokes! 

(Think that's a lot of repetitive movement? You've blinked about 50 million times so far!)

🥦  [input type=number-dial]

Every time you eat fruits and vegetables, you’re getting vitamins and antioxidants that help protect your cells from damage. If you eat [3] servings of fruit and veg a day, you've delivered 9,861 "repair kits” to your cells since you were born. Your body does the hard work — your job is to keep sending healthy supplies.

💪   [input type=number-dial] [litres|gallons]

Every minute you spend running or playing hard, your lungs pull in 40-60 [liters] of air, compaerd with 5-8 [litres] when resting. By age 9, if you play hard for [1] hour a day your lungs have handled around 11 million extra [liters] of air compared to just sitting around. Running around isn't just fun — it's a workout for your lungs, and yours are getting seriously strong.

❤️  [input type=number-dial], [input type=number] 

If you hug someone for [10] seconds, your body releases oxytocin, which lowers stress and helps you feel calm and safe. If you’ve give about [2] hugs a day since you were born, that’s roughly 6,500 positive moments where your body is quietly saying: “This person matters to me”

🧠  [input type=number]

Every night while you sleep, your brain sorts through everything you learned that day and files it into long-term memory — like a librarian working the night shift. If you sleep [10] hours a night, your brain has had about 32,870 hours of filing time. That's almost 4 years of a tiny librarian in your head organizing your entire life so far, making sure you remember the important things.

💧 [input type=number-dial] [litres|ml|oz]

If you drink about [6] glasses of water a day (that's about 1.5 [liters]), you've drunk roughly 5,000 [liters] of water in your life. That sounds like a lot — but an Olympic swimming pool holds 2.5 million liters, so actually you've only drank 0.2% of one. At the same rate, it would take you about 4,500 more years to drink the rest of the pool. 

## END / FLIP

We love you, we love your mind, happy 9th birthday bud ❤️
